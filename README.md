# NBA-tip-off-model

As it has become more available, sporting data and it’s applications has influenced everything from game strategy to how fans interact with the sports. More specifically, using this data to predict the outcome of sporting events has become a competitive field in itself for team managers, analysts and fans. For my project I plan to analyze the correlation between individual players performance in jump ball situations and their team’s ability to score first and to develop a predictive model that can be used to forecast these results. I plan to collect data from ESPN box scores including but not limited to which players jump,  which players wins the first possession, and which team scores first. I’ll use the results of these trials to develop rating systems to use to predict future trials using an adapted ELO model. I’ll compare my model against the Las Vegas consensus odds. In this proposal I’ve distilled the complex systems of sports into an environment with one predictive factor for use in simple modeling. I believe the concepts from this project can be abstracted to larger markets and applications.
